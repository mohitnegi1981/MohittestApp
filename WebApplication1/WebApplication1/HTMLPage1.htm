            1. Original Source&lt;BR&gt; Like all other manifestations of the syndrome, delusions
            are not unique to schizophrenia; they can be present in a variety of mental disorders,
            including mania, depression, and a variety of somatic illnesses. But the types of
            delusions that [Nobel Prize-winner John Forbes] Nash suffered from are particularly
            characteristic of schizophrenia, specifically of paranoid schizophrenia, the variant
            of the syndrome from which Nash apparently suffered. Their content was, as it often
            is, both grandiose and persecutory, often shifting from one to the other in the
            space of moments or even including both at the same time. At different times, as
            we know, Nash thought of himself as uniquely powerful, as a prince or an emperor;
            at other times he thought of himself as extraordinarily weak and vulnerable, as
            a refugee or a defendant in a trial. As is quite typical, his beliefs were what
            is called referential, in that he believed that a host of environmental clues&amp;amp;#8212;from
            newspaper passages to particular numbers&amp;amp;#8212;were specifically directed
            at him and that he alone was capable of appreciating their true meaning. And his
            delusions were multiple, a particularly common feature of paranoid schizophrenia,
            although all were organized, in subtle ways, around coherent themes.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;

            2. Original Source&lt;BR&gt;[In 2002], attacks on the rich have found little traction.
            The party more sympathetic to the wealthy has won control of the White House and
            the Senate since stocks began falling and joblessness began rising in 2000. One
            possible reason the class-war criticism has not yet stuck is that defining wealth
            is more complicated than it once was. Some people have homes that have appreciated
            enormously in value, but they can't sell them without buying a new, similarly expensive
            home. High earners who live in high-cost areas feel stretched. Lower earners who
            live in less expensive places don't feel poor.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
